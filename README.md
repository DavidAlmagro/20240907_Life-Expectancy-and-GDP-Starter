# Analysis of the Relationship Between GDP and Life Expectancy in Six Countries

## Project Description

This project aims to explore and analyze the relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and life expectancy across six selected countries. Using data from the World Health Organization and the World Bank, the analysis seeks to identify significant patterns and trends in the data.

## Main Objective

To explore the relationship between GDP and life expectancy to identify significant patterns and differences among the six selected countries.

## Research Questions

- How does life expectancy vary in relation to GDP among the six selected countries?
- Are there significant differences in GDP and life expectancy between the countries?
